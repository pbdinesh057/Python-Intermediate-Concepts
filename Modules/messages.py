#a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules allow you to organize your code into reusable files, making your programs more modular and manageable. You can use built-in modules that come with Python or create your own custom modules

def hello():
    print("Hello! Have a nice day")

def bye():
    print("Have a Great time!")

#Now create a another file called name.py and import messages module to call these functions
